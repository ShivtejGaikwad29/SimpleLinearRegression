# SimpleLinearRegression
Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to train the model relationship between two continuous . It aims to predict the value of a dependent variable (Y) based on the value of an independent variable (X).

Key Components:
Dependent Variable (Y): The outcome or the variable you want to predict.
Independent Variable (X): The predictor or the variable you use to make predictions.

Model Equation:
The relationship between X and Y is modeled using a linear equation:
Y=b0​+b1​X+ϵ
